The LCRD mission will provide a minimum of two years of continuous high rate optical communications in an operational environment and demonstrate a viable operational architecture for laser communication. Optical communications will enable NASA to undertake future complex missions that would require large increases in data volume with minimum impact to the user for accommodation of the communication system. LCRD will demonstrate the modulation and coding suitable for very high rate links.

In addition to growing vegetables in space, Veggie has supported a variety of experiments used to determine how plants respond to microgravity, provide real-time psychological benefits for the crew, and conduct outreach activities.  Veggie is a deployable plant growth unit that provides salad-type crops to the crew for a palatable, nutritious, and safe source of fresh food, in addition to supporting relaxation and recreation.  Veggie provides lighting, water and nutrient delivery for efficient plant growth, utilizing the cabin environment for temperature and relative humidity control and a source of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.  Veggie contains a large adjustable LED light bank that makes this system an ideal facility for experiments requiring a light source.  To grow plants, a reservoir supplies water via capillary action to root pillows containing substrate, nutrients and seeds.  Water is administered on-orbit to initiate seed germination and periodically added throughout the growth cycle to provide a continuous water supply until the vegetables are harvested. ",
